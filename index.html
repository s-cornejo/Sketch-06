            <h1>Krispy Kreme Begins Vaccine Mandates; <span class="noun">Employee</span> Prepares to be Terminated</h1>
            <p>The Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation in <span class="place">North Carolina</span> has joined the ranks of companies implementing vaccine mandates for <span class="noun">its employers</span>.</p>

            <p>In September, <span class="noun">the company</span> said in a press release that “certain employees and contractors” must get the COVID-19 vaccine by Nov. 30 or be terminated.</p>

            <p>“Since when does a company built on sugar get to dictate the health care decisions of its employees?” <span class="noun">John Richardson</span>, an information technology employee with Krispy Kreme, told <span class="noun">The Epoch Times</span>.</p>

            <p>“Krispy Kreme is only doing this with the corporate employees,” Richardson said. “They aren’t making any of the shop employees get vaccinated.”</p>

            <p>There are 363 shops in <span class="place">the United States</span>.</p>

            <p>In a letter to CEO <span class="noun">Mike Tattersfield</span>, Richardson said the company isn’t requiring shop employees to get vaccinated because “people would <span class="verb">leave</span>.”</p>

            <p>“For you to say this is for the health of the workers is <such class="adj">total and utter bologna</such>, and the <span>scary</span> thing is <span class="noun">Krispy Kreme</span> probably already knows that,” Richardson said. “If this was about the health of your workers, then the ones you should care most about are the ones who are <span class="noun">on the frontlines in the shops interacting with the public</span>. Why didn’t you include them?”</p>

            <p>If it were to mandate vaccines for <span class="noun">shop employees</span>, the company would <span class="verb">lose money</span>, Richardson said.</p>

            <p>“If the mandate is not good for <span class="noun">everyone</span>, then why is it good for <span class="noun">anyone</span>?” Richardson asked. “Shame on Krispy Kreme and the leaders that thought this was <span class="adj">a good idea</span> and had the power to enact it. It is needlessly jeopardizing the lives of your employees and their <span class="noun">families</span> for a virus that is 99 percent survivable by almost all of the population.”</p>

            <p>Richardson said Tattersfield has not <span class="verb">responded</span> to <span class="noun">his request</span> to end the mandate.</p>
